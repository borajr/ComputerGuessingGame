# ComputerGuessingGame
ComputerGame: 
Think of a number and type "go". Your computer starts guessing your number. 
Reply "lower" when the guess is too high, "higher" 
when it is too low, and "guessed" when the computer guessed
your number correctly.


HumanGame:


Enter a seed number, and the computer will think of a number between 0 and
99 that you have to guess in at most seven tries. Afterwards, you see your
 guessing history so you can learn to better play the game.
